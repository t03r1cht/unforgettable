## To Do

- [x] Add sick icon
- [x] Add support for local timezones
- [x] Ability to change item description and category (not title, because too much work to change that)
- [x] Dump entire database as SQL script
- [x] Use Flask-WTF for register form
- [x] Enforce password strength
- [x] Ask user to create admin account upon first application startup
- [X] Allow only admin account to change settings (like time zone)
- [ ] Run app on custom port (how to set the port outside of the app without having the app run first on a possibly non-vacant port?)
- [ ] Add Scheduler to regularly backup reminder items
- [ ] Put more settings (that make sense) in the user control panel
